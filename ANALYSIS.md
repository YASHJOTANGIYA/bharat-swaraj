## ⚠️ What "Bharat Swaraj" is Lacking

Based on a comparison with these giants, here is what your website is currently missing:

### 1. 🔴 Live TV Streaming Section
*   **The Gap:** All top news channels (TV9, VTV, ABP) have a prominent **"Live TV"** button or a sticky video player.
*   **Why we need it:** It instantly gives your site the authority of a "News Channel" rather than just a blog.
*   **Solution:** Add a YouTube Live embed section on the Home Page.

### 2. 🏙️ Dedicated "Rajkot" News Feed
*   **The Gap:** Currently, we have general categories (India, World). We lack a dedicated **"Rajkot Samachar"** or **"Saurashtra"** section on the homepage.
*   **Why we need it:** Your target audience is in Rajkot. They want to see their local news *first*.
*   **Solution:** Add a "Rajkot" tab in the main navigation and a specific row for "Rajkot News" on the Home Page.

### 3. 💰 Utility Widgets (The "Sticky" Factors)
*   **The Gap:** We don't have daily utility information.
*   **Why we need it:** Gujaratis love to check:
    *   **Gold/Silver Rates** (Rajkot is a gold hub).
    *   **Mandi Prices (APMC)** (Critical for farmers/traders).
    *   **Rashifal (Horoscope)** (Daily ritual for many).
*   **Solution:** Add a sidebar widget with daily Gold Rates and Horoscope.

### 4. 📱 Web Stories / Short News
*   **The Gap:** We only have standard long-form articles.
*   **Why we need it:** Younger audiences prefer "Shorts" or "Stories" (60 words or less).
*   **Solution:** Create a "Visual Stories" section.

### 5. 💬 WhatsApp Integration
*   **The Gap:** We have generic social links, but no direct "Join WhatsApp Group" CTA.
*   **Why we need it:** In Gujarat, news travels on WhatsApp. Building a WhatsApp subscriber base is the fastest way to grow.
*   **Solution:** Add a prominent "Join our WhatsApp" button in the Navbar or Footer.

### 6. 📹 Video Gallery
*   **The Gap:** We have text articles, but no dedicated video gallery.
*   **Why we need it:** Video consumption is higher than text.
*   **Solution:** Add a "Videos" page.
