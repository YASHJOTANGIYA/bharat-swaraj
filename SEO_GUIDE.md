# How to Rank First on Google

Getting your website to rank #1 on Google takes time and effort, but I have set up the technical foundation for you. Here is what you need to do next:

## 1. Submit to Google Search Console (Crucial!)
This is the most important step. You need to tell Google that your website exists.

1.  Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2.  Login with your Google account.
3.  Click **"Add Property"**.
4.  Enter your URL: `https://bharat-swaraj.vercel.app` (use the **URL Prefix** option on the right).
5.  **Verify ownership**: It might ask you to add an HTML tag.
    *   If it gives you a meta tag (e.g., `<meta name="google-site-verification" ... />`), copy it.
    *   Paste it into your `client/index.html` file inside the `<head>` section.
    *   Deploy your site again.
    *   Click "Verify" in Search Console.
6.  **Submit Sitemap**:
    *   Once verified, go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu.
    *   Enter `sitemap.xml` and click **Submit**.
    *   This tells Google exactly which pages to crawl.

## 2. Content is King
Google ranks websites that have high-quality, original content.
*   **Post News Regularly**: Since you are a news site, freshness is key. Post daily.
*   **Use Keywords**: Use words people search for (e.g., "Latest Gujarat News", "India Politics Today") in your titles and descriptions.
*   **Share on Social Media**: Share your articles on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter. The more traffic you get, the higher you rank.

## 3. Technical SEO (I have done this for you ✅)
*   **Meta Tags**: I added title, description, and keywords to your site.
*   **Sitemap**: I created a `sitemap.xml` file.
*   **Robots.txt**: I created a `robots.txt` file to guide Google.
*   **Mobile Friendly**: Your site is now responsive and works great on mobile.
*   **Speed**: Your site is fast (hosted on Vercel).

## 4. Get Backlinks
*   Try to get other websites to link to your articles. This builds "authority".

## 5. Be Patient
*   It can take **weeks or even months** to rank #1. Google needs to trust your site first.
*   Keep posting good content, and you will climb the rankings!
